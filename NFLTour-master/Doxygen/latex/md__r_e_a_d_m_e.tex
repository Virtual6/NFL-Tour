 Your agile team is to write an application that stores the given National Football League (N\+FL) information into an ordered or unordered map (not using the map or unordered map S\+TL or the QT map). The underlying data structure of the map is the choice of the team. The map should store either the stadiums and/or the souvenirs. The application will allow football fans to plan their dream vacation.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Write at least 10 agile stories (including description, tasks, test scenarios, and story points) before any software development.
\item Display all the information related to a particular football team (team name, stadium name, seating capacity, location, conference, surface type, stadium roof type, star player).
\item Create a list of the N\+FL teams sorted by team name.
\item Create a list of N\+FL stadiums and their corresponding team name sorted by stadium name.
\item Create a list of only the American Football Conference teams sorted by team name.
\item Create a list of only the National Football Conference teams sorted by team name.
\item Create a list of only the stadiums that have an “open” stadium roof type and their corresponding team name sorted by stadium name. Display the number of stadiums have an “open” roof.
\item Create a list of N\+FL star players and their corresponding team name sorted by team name.
\item Create a list of N\+FL stadiums and their corresponding team names sorted by seating capacity (smallest to largest). Be sure to display seating capacity. Display the total capacity of all N\+FL teams.
\item Create a list of N\+FL teams, their stadium names, their surface type, and their corresponding location sorted by surface type.

Planning a vacation\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Provide the capability for a football fan to visit any other stadium of their choice starting at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum traveling the shortest distance. Your Agile team should implement Dijkstra’s or the A$\ast$ algorithm. Display the total distance travelled.
\item Provide the capability for a football fan to plan his/her dream vacation by allowing a football fan to choose their starting stadium and all the other stadiums they would like to visit using the order specified. Display the total distance travelled.
\item Provide the capability to visit the all the stadiums starting at Ford Field traveling the shortest distance. a. Display the total distance traveled
\item Provide the capability for a football fan to plan his/her dream vacation by allowing a football fan to choose their starting stadium a. Then allow a football fan to select all other stadiums campuses they wish to visit b. Plan the trip starting with the selected stadium then visit each of the other stadiums in the most efficient order (recursively choose the stadium closest to the previous stadium) c. Display the total distance traveled
\item Determine the minimum spanning tree (M\+ST) connecting all the N\+FL stadiums using Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm. Display the associated mileage.
\item Perform a D\+FS starting at Hard Rock Stadium. Display the associated mileage.
\item Perform a B\+FS starting at Lambeau Field. Display the associated mileage.
\item When taking any trip\+: a. A football fan can purchase multiple souvenirs b. Your Agile team must keep track of the number of souvenirs purchased at each stadium Ag c. Display the total amount spent at each stadium and a grand total for all stadiums visited
\item Maintenance (administrator only -\/ requires a password to gain access) a. Provide the capability to add a new stadium and its corresponding souvenirs by having your program read from an input file given to the class b. Provide the capability to change the prices of the traditional souvenirs c. Provide the capability to add new traditional souvenirs d. Provide the capability to delete traditional souvenirs
\item Provide the ability to modify stadium information including capacity if a team moves into a new stadium. (administrator only) (The Los Angeles Rams are planning to move to Farmers Field in 2019).
\item What is the total seating capacity of the N\+FL teams?
